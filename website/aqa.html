<h1>audio question answering</h1>
<p>notes on my plans and progress for an audio question answering pipeline for huggingface</p>
<a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/33782">my initial AQA issue</a>
<p>initial inspiration came from looking for an issue to work on and coming across the DocumentQuestionAnswering pipeline PR</p>
<a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/18414">huggingface/transformers DocumentQuestionAnswering PR</a>
<p>as the idea is very similar to DQA/VQA just with a new modality, i plan to reference DQA for a lot of this new PR</p>
<p>------------------</p>
<p>going to go through the DQA code and come up with a plan for how to implement AQA. it should be very similar with the difference being applying STT instead of OCR</p>
