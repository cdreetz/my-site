  i previously studied statistics and data science, and have since done a bit of
  data engineering, machine learning, infrastructure, fullstack software, and ai
  engineering. primarily stuff to support ml/ai development and deployment.

<p>
  i enjoy most things that involve applied ml, but some of my favorite focuses
  are developer tools and data processing pipelines. i also have an interest in
  applications focused on domains such as aec and real estate.
